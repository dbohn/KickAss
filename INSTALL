Install for development
=======================

1. Ensure that you have installed:
* Composer (we assume a global install)
* Node.js with npm
* Bower
* Gulp (install with npm install -g gulp)

2. Run the following commands:
a. composer install
b. npm install
c. bower install

Now you can build the assets once by running:
```
gulp build
```

If you want to track changes to source files and recompile the assets automagically on save run:
```
gulp
```
